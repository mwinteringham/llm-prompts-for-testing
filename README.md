# LLM Prompts for Testing

Welcome to LLM prompts for testing. A repository that contains different prompts that can be used with LLMs such as ChatGPT to support your testing. Initially created as a support repository for [AI Assisted Testing](https://bit.ly/ai-testing), the goal of this repository is to create an expandsive list of prompts that can be used by anyone to help with their testing activities.

## How to use

Browse through the folders which describe prompts that can be used to help support your testing. Then copy and paste the prompt into your LLM of choice, replacing the square bracket sections with your contextual information.
