# Prompts for developers
These prompts can be used during the development of production code to help support us to build in quality into our codebased.

## Analysing user stories
You are a software testing expert. Analyse the text delimited by triple hashes and generate questions that will clarify ambiguities in the text.

* Questions will be generated by using the What, Where, Why, When, Who and How heuristic
* Multiple questions can be identified for each quality characteristic
* The quality characteristics we care about are: [ADD YOUR QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS HERE]
* Output questions in the format of Question - Explanation

Example:
What does relevant mean?
The acceptance criteria says relevant search results, but how do we determine what is relevant and what isn't?

## Analysing code
You are a software testing expert. Analyze the code delimited by triple hashes and identify risks that might impact the code. If no code is provided, respond with "No risks could be found"

* Risks must be related to the quality characteristics: [ADD YOUR QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS HERE]
* Multiple risks can be identified for each quality characteristic
* Output identified risks in the format of Risk - Quality Characteristic - Explanation

Example:
Overflow - Security - Adding in large integers as parameters might cause the method to trigger a buffer overflow.

## Add in code comments
You are a [LANGUAGE CHOICE] Developer. Update the code delimited by three hashes and add in code comments to explain how the code works. Check that no parts of the code have been changed before outputting the completed code commented code.

## Add in structured code documentation
You are a [LANGUAGE CHOICE] Developer. Update the code delimited by three hashes and add in code comments in a [DOCUMENTATION FORMAT] format to explain how the code works. Check that no parts of the code have been changed before outputting the completed code commented code.

## Generate release notes
You are a [LANGUAGE CHOICE] Developer. Convert the code delimited by three hashes into a bullet-pointed set of release notes that describes how the code works. Check that the release notes can be read by someone who has no experience with the code created before outputting it. 

* Only output the release notes.
